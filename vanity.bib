	abstract = {Membrane surface reconstruction at the nanometer scale is required for understanding mechanisms of subcellular shape change. This historically has been the domain of electron microscopy, but extraction of surfaces from speciﬁc labels is a di cult task in this imaging modality. Existing methods for extracting surfaces from ﬂuorescence microscopy have poor resolution or require high-quality super-resolution data that is manually cleaned and curated. Here we present a new method for extracting surfaces from generalized single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) data. This makes it possible to study the shape of speciﬁcally-labelled continuous structures inside of cells. We validate our method using simulations and demonstrate its reconstruction capabilities on SMLM data of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Our method is implemented in the open-source Python Microscopy Environment.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The endoplasmic reticulum’s (ER) structure is directly linked to the many functions of the ER but its formation is not fully understood. We investigate how the ER-membrane curving protein reticulon 4 (Rtn4) localizes to and organizes in the membrane and how that affects local ER structure. We show a strong correlation between the local Rtn4 density and the local ER membrane curvature. Our data further reveal that the typical ER tubule possesses an elliptical cross-section with Rtn4 enriched at either end of the major axis. Rtn4 oligomers are linear-shaped, contain about five copies of the protein, and preferentially orient parallel to the tubule axis. Our observations support a mechanism in which oligomerization leads to an increase of the local Rtn4 concentration with each molecule increasing membrane curvature through a hairpin wedging mechanism. This quantitative analysis of Rtn4 and its effects on the ER membrane result in a new model of tubule shape as it relates to Rtn4.
          
            Summary
            Rtn4 forms linear-shaped oligomers that contain an average of five Rtn4 proteins, localize to the sides of elliptical tubules, prefer orientations near parallel to the tubule axis, and increase local curvature of the ER membrane by increasing local Rtn4 density.},
