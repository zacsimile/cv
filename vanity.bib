This approach, which reduces computational post-processing and eliminates unnecessary interpolation or duplication of the data, is demonstrated on an upright variant of axially swept light-sheet microscopy (ASLM) that achieves a field of view, measuring 774 × 435 microns, that is 3.2-fold larger than previous models and a raw and isotropic resolution of ∼460 nm. Combined, we demonstrate the power of this approach by imaging sub-diffraction beads, cleared biological tissues, and expanded specimens.},

	abstract = {Adaptive optics (AO) can restore diffraction-limited performance when imaging beyond superficial cell layers in vivo and in vitro, and as such, is of interest for advanced 3D microscopy methods such as light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM). In a typical LSFM system, the illumination and detection paths are separate and subject to different optical aberrations. To achieve optimal microscope performance, it is necessary to sense and correct these aberrations in both light paths, resulting in a complex microscope system. Here, we show that in an oblique plane microscope (OPM), a type of LSFM with a single primary objective lens, the same deformable mirror can correct both illumination and fluorescence detection. Besides reducing the complexity, we show that AO in OPM also restores the relative alignment of the light-sheet and focal plane, and that a projection imaging mode can stabilize and improve the wavefront correction in a sensorless AO format. We demonstrate OPM with AO on fluorescent nanospheres and by imaging the vasculature and cancer cells in zebrafish embryos embedded in a glass capillary, restoring diffraction limited resolution and improving the signal strength twofold.},

Super-resolution ﬂuorescence microscopy offers the required spatial resolution but struggles to reveal more than four different targets simultaneously.

Here, we present a method for rapid multiplexed super-resolution microscopy that can, in principle, be applied to a nearly unlimited number of molecular targets by leveraging ﬂuorogenic labeling in conjunction with transient adapter-mediated switching for high-throughput DNA-PAINT (FLASH-PAINT). We demonstrate the versatility of FLASH-PAINT with four applications: mapping nine proteins in a single mammalian cell, elucidating the functional organization of primary cilia by nine-target imaging, revealing the changes in proximity of thirteen different targets in unperturbed and dissociated Golgi stacks, and investigating and quantifying inter-organelle contacts at 3D super-resolution.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202301112},
	abstract = {Abstract
          The endoplasmic reticulum's (ER) structure is directly linked to the many functions of the ER but its formation is not fully understood. We investigate how the ER-membrane curving protein reticulon 4 (Rtn4) localizes to and organizes in the membrane and how that affects local ER structure. We show a strong correlation between the local Rtn4 density and the local ER membrane curvature. Our data further reveal that the typical ER tubule possesses an elliptical cross-section with Rtn4 enriched at either end of the major axis. Rtn4 oligomers are linear-shaped, contain about five copies of the protein, and preferentially orient parallel to the tubule axis. Our observations support a mechanism in which oligomerization leads to an increase of the local Rtn4 concentration with each molecule increasing membrane curvature through a hairpin wedging mechanism. This quantitative analysis of Rtn4 and its effects on the ER membrane result in a new model of tubule shape as it relates to Rtn4.
          
            Summary
            Rtn4 forms linear-shaped oligomers that contain an average of five Rtn4 proteins, localize to the sides of elliptical tubules, prefer orientations near parallel to the tubule axis, and increase local curvature of the ER membrane by increasing local Rtn4 density.},

	abstract = {Membrane surface reconstruction at the nanometer scale is required for understanding mechanisms of subcellular shape change. This historically has been the domain of electron microscopy, but extraction of surfaces from speciﬁc labels is a difﬁcult task in this imaging modality. Existing methods for extracting surfaces from ﬂuorescence microscopy have poor resolution or require high-quality super-resolution data that are manually cleaned and curated. Here, we present NanoWrap, a new method for extracting surfaces from generalized single-molecule localization microscopy data. This makes it possible to study the shape of speciﬁcally labeled membranous structures inside cells. We validate NanoWrap using simulations and demonstrate its reconstruction capabilities on single-molecule localization microscopy data of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. NanoWrap is implemented in the open-source Python Microscopy Environment.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule localization microscopy enables three-dimensional fluorescence imaging at tens-of-nanometer resolution, but requires many camera frames to reconstruct a super-resolved image. This limits the typical throughput to tens of cells per day. While frame rates can now be increased by over an order of magnitude, the large data volumes become limiting in existing workflows. Here we present an integrated acquisition and analysis platform leveraging microscopy-specific data compression, distributed storage and distributed analysis to enable an acquisition and analysis throughput of 10,000 cells per day. The platform facilitates graphically reconfigurable analyses to be automatically initiated from the microscope during acquisition and remotely executed, and can even feed back and queue new acquisition tasks on the microscope. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by imaging hundreds of cells per well in multi-well sample formats. Our platform, implemented within the PYthon-Microscopy Environment (PYME), is easily configurable to control custom microscopes, and includes a plugin framework for user-defined extensions.},
